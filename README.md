# sotsFileEdit
command line editor to modify data files for SOTS 1 and SOTS 2

This is the first program I wrote that combines the concept of a file editor, xpath-like addressing, and runtime code generation passed from the command line. Later software expanded on this idea, but here's the first. I wrote this in 2011, don't expect the code to be perfect.
